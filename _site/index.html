              This delicious <span class="pumpkin">Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Bread</span> is full of chocolate inside and on top.  It is definitely the way to go when you kick off your pumpkin baking.

              <span class="hide-show-mobile">The top does look a little hard, but it was seriously so easy to do.
              My biggest tip for doing this is to make sure both chocolates are ready to go before you start to put it on the bread.  I like to spoon the white chocolate into a plastic baggie and cut one tip off.  Then spoon the chocolate on top of the bread.  Go ahead and get it to the edge, but try to keep from pushing it over.  As soon as you are done, grab that bag of white chocolate and drizzle it back and forth over the top from side to side.   Then immediately use a toothpick to drag it through the chocolate end to end.  Work quickly because the chocolate will start to set up.
              All that is left to do is brew a cup of coffee and have a slice or two of your handiwork while you enjoy a nice fall day!</span>

          <div class="col-md-12 col-lg-8">
            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>In a mixing bowl beat the sugars, oil, and eggs until creamy. Add the pumpkin and beat again. Sift together the baking soda, cinnamon, salt, nutmeg, and flour. Add to the pumpkin mixture alternately with the milk. Stir in the mini chocolate chips by hand.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spread the batter in a greased 9x5 loaf pan. Bake at 350* for 60-70 minutes. Cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then flip out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
              </li>
              <li>
                Place the chocolate chips and 1 teaspoon shortening in a microwave safe bowl. Heat for 30 seconds. Stir and heat again for 15-20 seconds. Set aside and repeat with the white chips and remaining shortening. Spoon the melted white chips into a plastic baggie with one tip cut off.
              </li>
              <li>
                Spoon the melted chocolate chips on the top of the bread. Go to the edge, but be careful to not push the chocolate over. Immediately drizzle the white chocolate from side to side. Use a toothpick to draw lines from end to end. Work quickly before the chocolate sets up. Makes 1 loaf.

            <p>
              First, let’s just get it out of the way that this homemade version puts the store-bought one to shame.  And that one from the bakery was excellent.  But this one.  Oh my.  It’s a good thing that this recipe yields two loaves, since we blow through it pretty quickly.  I’ve made this bread twice in the last two and a half weeks and have plans to make another batch before our family arrives for Thanksgiving.

              <span class="hide-show-mobile2">Like any homemade bread, this does take a few hours.  But the majority is down time.  So you can relax, read a book or if you’re like me, bake cookies.  Priorities people.
This bread has the perfect base – sturdy yet still soft.  It is filled with just the right amount of walnuts and cranberries, giving it a little texture and just a tad bit of sweetness.  It’s great warm straight from the oven, as toast for breakfast or as the base of a sandwich.  Particularly with Thanksgiving leftovers, but more on that later.</span>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>1 ½ cups warm water (105 to 115 degrees)</li>
              <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>

            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ol>
              <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, add the warm water and then sprinkle in the yeast. Next add in ½ cup of the flour, mix briefly to combine and then let the mixture sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast.
              </li>
              <li>
                Add in the honey, olive oil, salt and cinnamon. Mix on low speed briefly to combine. Add in the remaining 5 ½ cups flour, about one cup at a time, and mix on low speed until the dough is a shaggy mass. Switch to the dough hook. Knead on low speed for about 3 to 5 minutes, until the dough is soft and elastic, adding more flour if needed. (You can also knead the dough by hand. This amount of dough was pushing the capacity of my mixer, but it still worked fine that way).
              </li>
              <li>
                Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large lightly oiled bowl. Turn once to coat and then cover with plastic wrap. Allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in bulk, about 1 ½ hours.
              </li>
              <li>
                Lightly spray a large baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray and sprinkle with cornmeal.
              </li>
              <li>Gently deflate the dough and then transfer it to a lightly floured surface. Knead in the cranberries and walnuts by hand. Split the dough into two equal sized pieces and form each into a ball that is about 5 to 6 inches in diameter. Place both pieces on the preparing baking sheet. Cover with a damp towel(s) and let rise for another 30 to 45 minutes.</li>
              <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Sprinkle the tops of the loaves with additional all-purpose flour. Using a sharp serrated knife, cut a cross in the top of each loaf that is about 1-inch deep.</li>
              <li>Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, until the loaves are golden brown and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom. If you have an instant-read thermometer, the internal temperature should be 190 degrees. Transfer the loaves to a wire rack to cool before slicing.</li>

              It is dark and sweet bread with resilient texture of the best rye breads. The bread has number of non-traditional ingredients like chocolate, coffee, prune butter and molasses which produce beautifully browned crust with chocolate-colored crumbs and irresistible sweetness. I loved working with dough, it is nicely soft, alive and airy, it moves easily and it is not sticky. The shaping method is very unusual, and at first I did not make it right. I found the video after the bread has been already baked, so next time I will do it correctly. Still I have got delicatessen in my bread basket for dinner and breakfast and very happy family as a result. The bread is great with any cream spread and perfect for the open-faced sandwiches.
