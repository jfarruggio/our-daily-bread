            <p>Welcome.  We are classmates at The Starter League and learning html and css ("front-end" languages for web development).  With our instructors' help, we have learned so much.  In fact, we are both excited to continue learning when the semester ends.</p>
            <p>So, why a blog about bread?  Glad you asked.  In addition to our interest in front-end web development, we both love to eat; and that love extends to many foods.  But, we agreed our "can't-live-without" favorite is bread.  Also, the process of making bread is meditative, and the results are sustaining and a joy to share with others.  We hope some of the recipes on our site inspire you, and we hope you find a bread to love and share.</p>
